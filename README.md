# Challenge Assignment week 1: Code Refactor Starter Code

## The Horiseon Site
    The Horiseon site is offers a heading with nav links to the main content in the page, a large hero section containing an image, a three row section containing images and text content about services the company provides, and a benifits section in a colum on the right site of the page containing images and text. the page is then finished with a footer comprised of text and a copyright. 

## Accessibility and Functionality
    The Horiseon site is now fully functioning with working links and images that include "alt" descriptions. the index.html and style.css files are properly formated using best practices and semantic elements. I took the liberty of adding some comments to better divide the code into sections so that any developer in the future may navigate its content more clearly.
